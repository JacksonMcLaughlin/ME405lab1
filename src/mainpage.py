    @section sec_intro  Introduction
                        This is the documentation site for Tori Bornino,
                        Jackson Mclaughlin, and Zachary Stednitz's code used in
                        ME 405 - Mechatronics: Lab 1: Motor and Encoder
                        Drivers, taught in Winter 2022 by Dr. John Ridgly.
                        Source code is available at:
                        https://github.com/JacksonMcLaughlin/ME405lab1

    @section sec_enc    Encoder Reader Class
                        We wrote an encoder reader class
                        @ref encoder.Encoder "Encoder"
                        that allows
                        for a quadrature encoder to read and zero the position
                        of a motor.

    @section sec_mot    Motor Driver Class
                        We wrote a motor driver class
                        @ref motor.MotorDriver "MotorDriver"
                        that allows for
                        the user to set the duty cycle on a motor.
