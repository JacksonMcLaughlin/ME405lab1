    @section sec_intro  Introduction
                        This is the documentation site for Tori Bornino,
                        Jackson Mclaughlin, and Zachary Stednitz's code used in
                        ME 405 - Mechatronics: Lab 1: Motor and Encoder
                        Drivers, taught in Winter 2022 by Dr. John Ridgly.
                        Source code is available at:
                        https://github.com/JacksonMcLaughlin/ME405lab1

    @section sec_enc    We wrote an encoder reader class encoder.py that allows
                        for a quadrature encoder to read and zero the position
                        of a motor.

    @section sec_mot    We wrote a motor driver class motor.py that allows for
                        the user to set the duty cycle on a motor.
